Documentation for MetaCache mode "merge"


SYNOPSIS

    metacache merge <results_file>... -taxonomy <path> OPTIONS


DESCRIPTION

    You can also provide names of directories that contain
    results files instead of single filenames. MetaCache will
    search at most 10 levels deep in the file hierarchy.

    This mode classifies reads by merging the results of multiple, independent 
    queries. These might have been obtained by querying one database with 
    different parameters or by querying different databases with different 
    reference targets or build options.

    IMPORTANT: In order to be mergable, independent queries 
    need to be run with options:
        -tophits -queryids -lowest species
    and must NOT be run with options that suppress or alter default output 
    like, e.g.: -nomap, -no-summary, -separator, etc.

    Possible Use Case:
    In case your system has not enough memory for one large database, you could
    split up the set of reference genomes into several databases and query these
    in succession. The results of these independent query runs can then be 
    merged to obtain a classification based on the whole set of genomes


NON-OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

    -taxonomy <path>   directory with taxonomic hierarchy data 
                       (see NCBI's taxonomic data files)


BASIC OPTIONS

    -out <file>        Redirect output to file <file>.
                       If not specified, output will be written to stdout.
                       If more than one input file was given all output
                       will be concatenated into one file.

    -lowest  <rank>    Do not classify on ranks below <rank>.
                       default: sequence

    -highest <rank>    Do not classify on ranks above <rank>.
                       default: domain

    -hitmin <t>        Sets classification threshhold to <t>.
                       A read will not be classified if less than t features
                       from the database are found in it.
                       Higher values will increase precision at the expense of
                       lower sensitivity.

    -max-cand <no>     maximum number of reference taxon candidates to 
                       consider for each query; A large value can significantly 
                       decrease the querying speed!
                       default: 2


OUTPUT FORMATTING OPTIONS

    -nomap             Don't report classification for each individual query
                       sequence; show summaries only (useful for quick tests).
                       default: off (= print per-read mappings)

    -mapped-only       Don't list unclassified queries.
                       default: off (= print all mappings)

    -taxids            Print taxon ids in addition to taxon names.
                       default: off

    -taxids-only       Print taxon ids instead of taxon names.
                       default: off

    -omit-ranks        Don't print taxon ranks.
                       default: off (= do print taxon ranks)

    -separate-cols     Prints *all* mapping information (rank, taxon name, taxon ids)
                       in separate columns (see option "-separator").
                       default: off (= print rank:taxon_name in one column)

    -separator <text>  string that separates output fields (sequence name, 
                       classification result, etc.)
                       default: "\t|\t"

    -queryids          Show a unique id for each query.
                       Note that in paired-end mode a query is a pair of two 
                       read sequences. This option will always be activated if 
                       "-hits-per-seq" is given.
                       default: off

    -lineage           Report complete lineage for per-read classification
                       starting with the lowest rank found or allowed and
                       ending with the highest rank allowed. See also
                       options '-lowest' and '-highest'.
                       default: off

    -no-query-params   don't show query settings at the beginning of the
                       mapping output
                       default: do show query settings

    -no-summary        don't show result summary & mapping statistics at the
                       end of the mapping output
                       default: do show the summary


ADVANCED ANALYSIS OPTIONS
    
    -abundances        Show absolute and relative abundance of each taxon.
     [<filename>]      If a valid filename is given after '-abundances',
                       the list will be written to a separate file.
                       default:off

    -abundance-per     Show absolute and relative abundances for each
    <rank>             taxon on one specific rank.
                       Classifications on higher ranks will be estimated by 
                       distributing them down according to the relative 
                       abundances of classifications on or below the given rank.
                       If '-abundances <file>' was given, this list will
                       be printed to the same file.
                       default:off


EXAMPLES

    Classify reads based on the three different databases:
        metacache query 1.db reads.fa -tophits -queryids -lowest species -out res1.txt 
        metacache query 2.db reads.fa -tophits -queryids -lowest species -out res2.txt
        metacache query 3.db reads.fa -tophits -queryids -lowest species -out res3.txt
        metacache merge res1.txt res2.txt res3.txt -taxonomy ncbi_taxonomy
