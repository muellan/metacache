Documentation for MetaCache mode "annotate"

SYNOPSIS
    metacache annotate taxid <input_sequence> <mapping files>... OPTIONS

DESCRIPTION
    Annotate sequences with taxonomic metadata using identifiers like
    accession, accession.version or gi numbers in the FASTA/FASTQ 
    sequence header as keys. 

    Note that if you want to use the *.accession2taxid files provided by the
    NCBI as mapping files you will need a considerable amount of memory 
    since these files are several gigabytes in size.

    You can also provide names of directories that contain
    'sequence id to taxid' mapping files instead of single filenames.
    MetaCache will search at most 10 levels down in the file hierarchy.

OPTIONS
    -out <filename>      Redirect output to file <filename>.
                         If not specified, output will be written to stdout.

    -id=acc              use accession ids
       =accver           use accession.version ids
       =gi               usi gi ids
                         default: "accver"

    -field-sep <string>  String that separates header fields.
                         default: space

    -value-sep <string>  String that separates annotation field name and
                         value.
                         default: "|"

EXAMPLES
    Annotate sequences in file 'artificialReads.fna' with their taxonomic ids
        ./metacache annotate taxid artificialReads.fna nucl_wgs.accession2taxid

    Use all mapping files in directory 'taxmapdir'
        ./metacache annotate taxid artificialReads.fna taxmapdir
